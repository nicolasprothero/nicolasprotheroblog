### Fast Feeling

Ever since I was a kid there was the occassional occurance where it felt as if my life was running much faster then it typically did. The feeling is like when you (uncap the framerate in a game so the animations run faster?). Anyways thats currently happening to me now. It feels like my music is 2x the actual bpm, the lyrics are rushed, the singer is standing on the balls of their feet, just trying to get the sounds out. It happened often as a kid, typically during tests, I could hear every sound in that room, even the clock ticking (ticking much more than just once per second). I could hear every sniffle, scoot, shuffle, scoff. I could hear myself in my head talking over questions faster than I could even process it. I never know what causes it, it can just start randomly, but I believe it is when I am stressed. I did just drink a coffee, an iced coffee from Opus with some soy milk, all taken on am empty stomach. But, the drink is only halfway done. And I drank water while drinking it. I do not know if it has anything to do with coffee because I can drink coffee without having this feeling, and I can have this feeling without drinking coffee.
