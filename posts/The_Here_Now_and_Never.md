# The Here Now and Never

In my sophmore year, 2023, I spent my summer in Japan. I didn't expect to go at first because they had already selected people who were going and I am pretty sure I was not included on the waitlist. But, thanks to efforts put in by Nathan, I ended up on the final list of people selected to go.

Now it is February 2024 and I feel that I am forgetting things. I know that I do not have good memory, something that is apparent in my family. I get reminded of my trip trough photos, but I am reminded of things that a couple months ago I would think about constantly without having to be reminded.

The idea of this was hard to accept, as it was something that I thought I would never forget. And so I decided to make a website, one because this semester I feel that I stopped making art for myself, and two because I wanted to make art that lived on the web.

A big thing I did while I was there was take photos. Photos of the places I went to and photos of my friends. I decided to make a website to celebrate these photos, specifically the photos that we took on the kodak ektar h35 that Rama bought days before we took our final trip to Fuji Rock.

Please enjoy them.
