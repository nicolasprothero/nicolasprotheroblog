# In Defense of the Poor Website

The poor website is information that lives on the web. It can be designed poorly - or not designed at all. It’s content and the internet’s accessibility are the driving factors behind its existence. The poor website is not spread using algorithms, or hosted on a social media platform. It is hidden among the billions of other websites unless an individual knows its URL and willingly enters it into a browser’s search bar. The poor website is independently created, the author is also the editor, the designer, and the developer. It is a product that benefits from living on the web rather than on any other medium.

A poor website can simply be columns of black text in the browsers default font, with the occasional underlined blue hyperlinks scattered within it. It can be a collection of ones meditations, an artistic manifesto, or even just nonsensical word clutter that now lives digitally. It can be a single page website, with all of its information located in one HTML file, or a sprawling collection subpages that link each other like nodes in a tree. 

A poor website does not care for traditional design practices. It is too typical for information to not exist on the web because of both the design and development process that has to go into it. A poor website is the product of overcoming this [hurdle just enough]. Enough that an individual can share their voice, and others can hear it.


### The “Design” of the Poor Website

Brutalism is a word often associated with architecture and is characterized by its use of raw concrete, and a lack of ornamentation. The term comes from the French word “béton brut” which translates to "raw concrete”. In the world of web design there is a popular trend called brutalist website design, which takes inspiration from the architectural style. The trend can be defined by two main aesthetics, and there are arguments on which is the “real” one. Some believe it is the popular design conventions that emphasize an ‘intentionally ugly’ look, but others think it is David Bryant Copeland’s definition, base HTML that much like its architectural counterpart is raw, and focuses only on the content and its readability, with little to no styling.

I believe that a poor website does not have a specific design, and that it is more of a genre or label that can be given to a website. However, I do acknowledge the overlap in my argument for the poor website and Copeland’s definition and guidelines to brutalist web design. Copeland’s brutalist manifesto emphasizes that a focus of brutalist website design is to share its content and allow readability in all browsers or devices. But, he adds that styling is not typically welcomed, and if used is very limited. I do believe that a large amount of websites that could be considered a poor website do follow these guidelines, but most likely it occurs unintentionally.

A poor website’s design should be a second thought, and is typically present to enhance the content itself. It is design that should not impede on the development or the publishing process. While saying this, I do not want to make the claim that a poor website is simply lacking clear layout and interface styling. I believe that the definition of a poor website is simply a website that leverages the internet’s ability to provide vast accessibility and spread of information for a specific purpose, and does not focus on following correct developmental and design practices. 


### Self Publishing on the Web

When creating a website, styling and following correct developmental conventions is limiting. It leads people away from hosting their information or beliefs independently on the web. These limitations lead them towards website builders and social media. While I do applaud website builders for allowing users to create websites without the stress of development, they have their limitations on individuality. These platforms typically lead to a loss of control and ownership of content, privacy concerns, and specific guidelines and terms of services that must be followed. If content does not follow the specific and often strict guidelines, it can be forcefully removed or even have the owner restricted or blocked.

A poor website allows for the democratization of online presences. A broader range of individuals can create a web presence, and promotes the sharing of diverse perspectives. The poor website is the modern self-publishing, it is content that is being independently produced and distributed using the web. The individual takes on the role of author, publisher, (and now developer), and oversees the process of creating, editing, designing, and hosting their work. It is information that is not just a social media post or belonging simply to a subpage, as the poor website wants full control over its freedom.


### The Value of Websites

The poor website challenges traditional notions of value when it comes to information that belongs on the web. On the internet, a website that is not designed and developed according to typical practice, is often overlooked by both human and machine. Non-typical design can lead people to question the validity of a website, or believing that the content is not worth their time. Bad developmental practices can lead to a web scraper simply passing over a website that lacks a well-defined HTML structure or clear data presentation. But, a poor website is not created to be liked by all, and often overlooked. A poor website’s content should be questioned, its visual design should be judged. It does not care for web scrappers as its goal is not to be the first result from a search engine. 

As someone who enjoys designing and developing websites, I still find importance in designing websites that fall into the definition of a poor website. It is easy to get distracted with the process of ensuring a website provides a good user experience, or uses modern frameworks and tools. But in the end, a website is simply information that lives on the web. It is a medium but it also a location, a site for something to belong in. Creating a website with the goal of providing content online 


I believe that if desired, information and personal content should be hosted on the web. It allows a voice to be heard by anybody that has access to an internet connected web browser.
