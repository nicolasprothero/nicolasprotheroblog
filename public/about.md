## about me

![images/aboutme](/images/photobooth.png)

not too sure what to write here. enjoy this photobooth photo of me, it felt fitting. i like to make art? and code websites like this one. I also like to read, one day I hope to write, maybe once I have more things to write about. currently living in Gainesville, Florida USA but hopefully that will change soon. thank you

this website is so that i can keep track of some low writings, and works that i do not have a place for. it is also an excuse to use next.js, tailwind, and markdown files.
